        Information Problem
            This used to be a place you explained seriously to me what problem you're going to solve, but then every year people picked the CRIME data set and discovered that cars should be banned in College Park. Think of this as telling your professor what you're curious about.
            Data set: https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search
            Technologies: Listed in the assignment description 
            Explain which open API you have chosen to work with, and why.
            The open API I am interested in using is the TV maze API. I have selected this one because I am someone who loves tv shows and I feel that it would be interesting to analyze the data on popular tv shows, as it is something that has always interested me. I looked for a Netflix API, but they currently do not have one that is public, and thus was the only open API I could find.  This is a topic that I am passionate about and I feel that I could come up with a cool visualization with this topic.
            What is the information problem you're hoping to examine?
            I am hoping to make a more accessible and easy-to-use way to find shows to watch. I want to reduce the time and effort it takes to find a show.
            Why?
            When someone finishes watching a show that they really liked it is common for them to not know what to watch next. People typically feel like the next watch wonâ€™t be as good. I want to help make options and filtering through the options more accessible. While this is a smaller issue, it affects day-to-day life and I want to make it more convenient to find shows that people love.
            What is your app/visualization going to explore in your data set?
            It is going to group shows by genre, links common actors, similar plot lines, number of seasons, and other information that helps people decide what to watch.
