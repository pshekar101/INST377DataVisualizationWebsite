      <h3>About NextWatch</h3>
      <p> The information problem we are striving to solve is helping people find a show to watch. Typically When someone finishes watching a show that they really liked it is common for them to not know what to watch next.
         People typically feel like the next watch will not be as good as what they just finished. I am hoping to make a more accessible and easy-to-use way to find shows to watch. I want to reduce the time and effort it takes to find a show.
         The goal want to help make options and filtering through the options more accessible. While this is a smaller issue, it affects day-to-day life and I want to make it more convenient to find shows that people love. </p>

      <p> In order to create this website I have used the TVMaze API in order to get important information about shows such as number of episodes, synopsis, genre, characters, etc</p>
